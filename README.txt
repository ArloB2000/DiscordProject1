You will need to have developer mode enabled on discord to get the ids of the user, server, and/or channel you want to log
to get your user token, load up discord on preferably chrome and f12 and press the phone/tablet icon to go into mobile view. You may have to then refresh your browser.
Go into one of the tabs should be application and scroll down after going into the discord.com subtab in the expanded local storage tab and you should see on the left column a variable called token.
copy the token and in a textbox anywhere remove the quotation marks and copy that and paste it when it asks for your token or just put it in the json config file.

If you want to update your settings settings.bat should do the trick, if there's an error, just replace everything in Config.json with {}
